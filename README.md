💖 power by vite + react + wagmi + ts

## QuickStart

click `Use this template`

## Motivation

For now, most of dapps frontend ecosystem were build on webpack and react. The most popular tool is `CRA`. As we know, the dev experience of webpack is not very good by codes growing.

`Vite` is the next generation frontend tooling. It's fast and more easily to use. So I build the project for dapps DX improvement.

pnpm i

pnpm run dev
